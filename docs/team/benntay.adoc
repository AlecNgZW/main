Our users interact via CLI and GUI created with JavaFX. Written in Java, experience what many are enjoying.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the _Meal Planner feature_.
** What it does: Allows users to add their desired recipes to a Meal Planner so that they can plan their days' meals.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can not only browse recipes, but also keep a record of the recipes they want to try on which specific days.
** Highlights: This enhancement was originally unsupported by the AB4 code; it is a completely new component feature.
//** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

//*To be updated*

//* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

//* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
