life in the kitchen.

== Summary of contributions (To be updated...)
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view ingredients*
** What it does: Allows the user to list ingredients via search and view the details of individual ingredient.

** Justification: This is a core feature of the application which allow user to search and view ingredients.

** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing data structure of the application. As the existing data
structure only supports managing of single core data, the Model Component has to be revamp to take in different data
for multiple features to be implement in time to come. Since there are common functions such as add, delete, edit and
 search, this requires design of classes that are generic to reduce duplication in code.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
