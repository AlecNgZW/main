By: `Team W10-4`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check
link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/souschef/commons/util/XmlUtilTest
.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/souschef/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`]
for
code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.souschef.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible
for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`ModelSet`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AppContentChangedEvent` when the Sous Chef data are changed, instead of asking
the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `GenericListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== Modularisation
*List Panel*

_Brief overview_:
Many of the features (such as MealPlanner, HealPlan, IngredientManager, Recipes, Favourites)
need to use the list panel section to display their own UniqueType classes. Therefore, this
has been abstracted and modularised for easier implementation of usage and for any future
implementation of new components which may need to use the list panel. This is done by inserting
generic classes into the hierarchy.

_Old Hierarchy_:

image::UiPanelOldHierarchy.png[width="800"]

_New Hierachy_:

image::UiPanelNewHierarchy.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Not all the components are shown, only MealPlanner and Recipe components are shown
in the diagram as an example. Notice how the new generic abstract classes are simply inserted
between the superclass and subclass of the old hierarchy to give the new hierarchy.

_Explanation_:

With the GenericListPanel, GenericCard and GenericPanelSelectionChangedEvent classes,
new features which wish to use the UI list panel simply have to have their respective
classes extend these three abstract classes and implement their methods accordingly.
Then the respective fxml files for [feature]ListPanel and [feature]Card have to be
created.

_MainWindow.java and UiManager.java_:

To switch between different list panels for different features, switchTo[feature]ListPanel()
methods have to be implemented in MainWindow. This method gets the respective filteredList
from the model within modelSet within logic and uses it to change the generalListPanel.
The switchTo[feature]ListPanel() method has to then be implemented in UiManager (and
declared in Ui interface) so that the method can be called through UiManager.


_Usage_:

Now in order to switch between the different list panels, the developer just has to
call their switchTo[feature]ListPanel() function from the Ui interface. This can be done
anywhere as long as they have access to UiManager.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AppContentParser` class to parse the user command.'
.  `AppContentParser` passed necessary model to each feature parser such as `IngredientParser` according to the context.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add onion 100
gram 10-23-2018")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the adding ingredient
image::LogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponent.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/model/ModelSet.java[`ModelSet.java`],
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `ModelSet`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Sous Chef application data.
** Contains multiple `Model` each in-charge of a feature's data.
* shares a single instance of VersionedAppContent to ensure single version of truth.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `Model`,

* each represents a feature-unique data.
** ensures data abstraction for each feature.
* is reusable as model is now generic.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<T extends UniqueType>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component (The given diagram only shows the extensions of 2 functions.)
image::StorageClassDiagramRevamp.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the various xml files from each of the different functions. Namely recipe.xml, ingredients.xml and healthplan.xml
* can do a context switch for storing information into the correct xml file for the function.
* generalized in its implementation for easy extension
* controls information by passing a single appContent unit around the system.
* With the new implementation of the storage component, calls at the upper layers are generalized and all components shares
common calls for load and saving.
* The new storage component introduces a new abstract parent (XmlFeatureStorage) and also a new interface
(XmlSerializableGeneric) to make all the calls of load and save to be generic to allow easy functional implementation
without much creation of new methods at the storage level. Just by calling the context switch and also the save and load
calls the intended result will be achieved.




[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.souschef.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Ingredient Manager
==== Select feature of the Ingredient Manager(to be implemented)

Selecting recipe based on ingredients that are currently in the inventory is a key feature of Ingredient Manager.
In this sense, you can think of the Ingredient Manager as storing and manipulating ingredient related information
rather than person related information.
However, select feature of it is noteworthy in that it enables users to filter out necessary knowledge outside of the
ingredient manager(e.g. recipes), using the information stored in it(e.g. ingredients).

In AppContentParser, Ingredient Manager is passed two model parameters, which are recipe model and ingredient model.
If you execute select command, it conducts search based on ingredients in inventory. Then It takes
additional ingredients in as parameters, no matter if they are currently in inventory or not.
Based on those ingredients, it conducts second round of search.
The ingredients you put before 'optional' command would be considered as the ones that you want to necessarily
include in your recipe search.
The ingredients following 'optional' command is considered as the ones that you want to include as much as possible.
Ingredient Manager display recipes sorted based on the number of optional ingredients, with the ones that contains most
number at the top.
Therefore, you can think of it as a 2 step, where 'must' ingredients filter out the recipes and 'optional'
ingredients sorts the recipe.

The difference between normal search using ingredient and current select method lies in the fact that it conducts
search based
 on ingredients in inventory as a default.
Although you just put in 'select' without any additional parameters, it shows the recipes that contains most number
of ingredients in inventory so that increases the possibility for user to use up the ingredients that are recorded in
 inventory.

// tag::mealplannerimplementation[]
=== Meal Planner feature
==== Current Implementation

===== Model
The Meal Planner feature is supported by the classes *Meal* and *Day*.


****
Supporting classes:

* *Day*: encapsulates a *LocalDate* _date_  and an *ObservableList<Meal>* _mealList_
containing 3 meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner). *Day* objects are always instantiated
with 3 empty *Meal* objects in the _mealList_.
** An empty *Day* is defined as having 3 empty meals in its _mealList_.
** 2 *Day* objects are defined as same (through overriding equals() method) as long
as they have the same *LocalDate* _date_. This is to ensure no duplication of dates
within the Meal Planner.

* *Meal*: encapsulates a *Optional<Recipe>* _recipe_ and an int _slot_ indicating which
meal slot each *Meal* object is (0 for breakfast, 1 for lunch, 2 for dinner).

** An empty *Meal* is defined having no recipe, i.e. empty *Optional*.
****

Class diagram:

image::MealPlannerClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Brief explanation:

Meal Planner is currently implemented as a list of non-empty *Day* objects. This is
ensured as *Day* objects are only instantiated when recipes are added to a certain
_date_, with that _date_ being assigned to its *Day* object. When all the recipes
are deleted from a certain *Day*, the *Day* object is removed from the Meal Planner.
*Day* objects in the Meal Planner list panel are sorted in chronological order according
to their dates. This is done by sorting the list when instantiated and when *Day* objects
are added or removed.

===== Logic
For Meal Planner commands to be accessible, context has to be switched to "Meal Planner
via the command `-mealplanner`. From there, the Meal Planner commands can be used and
*AppContentParser* will redirect the different commands to their respective CommandParser.

====== _Plan Command_: `plan`
The plan command adds a recipe from the _recipeModel_ to the _mealPlannerModel_. Therefore
both models have to be passed to *PlanMealCommandParser*.

Within *PlanMealCommandParser*, it parses the target _date_ from a *String* into a *LocalDate*.
Only dates from the present or future are allowed to be entered.
This *LocalDate* object is then used to find out whether _mealPlannerModel_ currently
contains a *Day* with the target _date_. If such a *Day* object already exists, it is
taken from _mealPlannerModel_ to be used in *PlanMealCommand*. Else, a new *Day* object is
instantiated with the target *LocalDate* _date_. The target _meal_ is then taken from
the *Day* object. _mealPlannerModel_, target _day_ target _recipe_ and target _meal_ are then passed
to *PlanMealCommand*.

Within the execute method of *PlanMealCommand*, target _recipe_ is then added the target _meal_ and
target _day_ is then added to mealPlannerModel.

Finally, the new content is committed via _mealPlannerModel.commitAppContent()_.

====== _Display Command_: `display`
The display command simply calls _ui.switchToMealPlanListPanel()_ method so as to display the
Meal Planner's current meal plans.

The reason is that since the recipe list has to be visible for users to select recipes to add to
the Meal Planner, the panel does not switch to show the Meal Planner list view immediately
when context is switched to "Meal Planner". Thus, there is a separate *display* command for
displaying the Meal Planner when the user needs to view it.

====== _Clear Command_: `clear`
The clear command simply clears the Meal Planner by setting (i.e. replacing) the existing UniqueList
of *ModelManager<Day>* _mealPlannerModel_ with a new empty UniqueList.

====== _Delete Command_: `delete`
The delete command deletes a specified *Day* from the _mealPlannerModel_ along with all its _meals_.
The *Day* is specified by its index as seen on the list panel.

// end::mealplannerimplementation[]

// tag::favouritesimplementation[]
=== Favourites list

This feature allows users to have a quick reference to all of their favourite recipes. Users are able to add recipes
that they like a lot, or that they cook often to the favourites list. Users are also able to search, display details,
and remove any entry within the favourites list.

==== Adding to Favourites
While browsing the recipes in the recipe context, and when a user likes a recipe at a particular `INDEX`, they can
execute the `favourite INDEX` command. The recipe selected would be copied from the recipe model, and added to an array
list in the favourites model.
// end::favouritesimplementation[]

// tag::recipemanagement[]
=== Recipe Management
==== All-field search
The all-field search matches keywords with details of `Recipe`.
Each keyword searches through the `Name`, `Tag` and even `Difficulty` and `CookTime` of every recipes. Such search feature provides a complex querying, rather than a superficial search on merely recipes' name.

===== Current Implementation
To implement this feature, recipe `Model` is implemented with `FilteredList`. This list takes in of a predicate to
filter away recipes that does not meet the requirement.

The desired search keywords, once parsed as `List` of `String` will be turned to `Stream` checking for matching words
 in the a recipe `Name`, complete matching of `CookTime`, matching of `Difficulty` and finally exact matching of any
 one `Tag` in a `Stream` of tags. This ultimately returns a `boolean` that decides whether a `Recipe` stays or remain
  in
 the `FilteredList`.

image::recipe_search_seq.png[width="800"]

===== Why it is implemented that way:
Due to the existing data structure implemented by model, to access the attributes within a recipe, the system needs
to use its getter and perform matching with its keywords. Hence, a filter via predicate testing is deemed fit.

===== Alternatives:
Tag saving recipes that uses it +
Pros - Search done more effectively as the system only need to display all recipes stored in a tag +
Cons - Bi-directional association, increase difficulty in maintaining data integrity

==== Cook-mode
The cook-mode is a feature on its own with its individual feature `Ui` and commands. The switch to cook-mode can be triggered by choosing a `Recipe` listed.

===== Current Implementation
Upon `Command` execution, logic identify the context, which in this case cook-mode, of the application and perform a
switch. Subsequent commands will be parse further by a parser unique to cook-mode. These commands allows the
navigation between instructions, possibility controlling of a real-time timer is specified by the `Instruction`. A
`ArrayList` is stored with the current index being saved to track and allow movement forward/backward between
instructions.
// end::recipemanagement[]

=== Health Plan list

This is a feature that users can access to have health plans to manage their diet and health due to dietary
needs of their choice. Users are able to add a health list to based on their specifications:
whether they intend to gain/lose/maintain weight from their
set age, current weight and also their current height. this will then tell them what is the required calories to
eat per day to hit their target.

==== Current implementation

* Users are able to add to the list based on their personal settings: name, age, height, weight, target weight,
 duration, scheme (gain/loss/maintain)
* Users are able to delete entries that they do not want to keep anymore.
* Users are aso able to edit entries which information is incorrect.

==== Ongoing implementation (Adding of meal plans)

The new implementation of this feature should allow users to add meal plans from the meal planner feature, and also
calculate the nutritional intake against the required calculate intake for the day and then also calculate the
percentage of the set target by calculated by the system
met by the user's own personal intake.
This will then also help to compare the intake taken by the user via the meal plans versus the required target calculated
by the system using the age, height and current weight of the user.

==== Ongoing implementation (Expiry of health plans)

The new implementation of this feature should have an expiry feature that counts down the system base on the app's date
 against the duration set by the user.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.souschef.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.souschef.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.souschef.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.souschef.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/souschef/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Sous Chef depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml
.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample recipes. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a recipe

. Deleting a recipe while all recipes are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes using the `list` command. Multiple recipes in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First recipe is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted recipe shown in the status message.
   Timestamp
   in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No recipe is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
